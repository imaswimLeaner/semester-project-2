Create form(s) that allow products to be added and edited. The form must allow the user to toggle whether a product is featured.
Product images

For adding/editing product images use either of these 2 methods:

    Use a file upload field to upload images to Strapi, or
    
    Use a text input that allows a URL to be entered. This allows an image from an external URL to be used as the product image.

You can find the fields for each in Strapi. Use only one to display a product image. Delete existing product
